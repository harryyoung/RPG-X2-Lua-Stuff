Lua Updates Source Code
By Harry Young
For RPG-X2

These are my Lua-Updates for 3rd party maps.
I'll stow them here so you can get them. 

If you wish to use any of this code for your own work
they are licensed under CC-BY 3.0 unported as described here:

If you wish to test this code just download it and put the folders here:
".../baseef/scripts/lua"
They will be loaded with the map.


If You have any problems leave me an issue here or contact me
